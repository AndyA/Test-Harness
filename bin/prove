      --formatter   Result formatter to use. See TAP::Harness.
 -a,  --archive     Store the resulting TAP in an archive file.
 -j,  --jobs N      Run N test jobs in parallel (try 9.)

=head2 Reading from C<STDIN>

If you have a list of tests (or URLs, or anything else you want to test) in a
file, you can add them to your tests by using a '-':

 prove - < my_list_of_things_to_test.txt

See the C<README> in the C<examples> directory of this distribution.

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Default Test Directory

If no files or directories are supplied, C<prove> looks for all files
matching the pattern C<t/*.t>.

=head2 Colored Test Output

Specifying the C<--color> or C<-c> switch is the same as:

 prove --harness TAP::Harness::Color

Colored test output is the default, but if output is not to a terminal, color
is disabled.  You can override this by adding the C<--color> switch.

=head2 C<--exec>

Normally you can just pass a list of Perl tests and the harness will know how
to execute them.  However, if your tests are not written in Perl or if you
want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the C<-e>, or C<--exec>
switch:

 prove --exec '/usr/bin/ruby -w' t/
 prove --exec '/usr/bin/perl -Tw -mstrict -Ilib' t/
 prove --exec '/path/to/my/customer/exec'

=head2 C<--merge>

If you need to make sure your diagnostics are displayed in the correct
order relative to test results you can use the C<--merge> option to
merge the test scripts' STDERR into their STDOUT. 

This guarantees that STDOUT (where the test results appear) and STDOUT
(where the diagnostics appear) will stay in sync. The harness will
display any diagnostics your tests emit on STDERR.

Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note that if anything
that appears on STDERR looks like a test result the test harness will
get confused. Use this option only if you understand the consequences
and can live with the risk.

=head1 PERFORMANCE

Because of its design, C<TAP::Parser> collects more information than
C<Test::Harness>.  However, the trade-off is sometimes slightly slower
performance than when using the C<prove> utility which is bundled with
L<Test::Harness>.  For small tests suites, this is usually not a problem.
However, enabling the C<--quiet> or C<--QUIET> options can sometimes speed up
the test suite, sometimes running faster than C<prove>.

few places (thanks Andy!).
