Boolean options:

 -v,  --verbose     Print all test lines.

      --reverse     Run the tests in reverse order.
 -q,  --quiet       Suppress some test output while running tests.
 -Q,  --QUIET       Only print summary results.
 -p,  --parse       Show full list of TAP parse errors, if any.
      --directives  Only show results with TODO or SKIP directives.
      --timer       Print elapsed time after each test.
 -T                 Enable tainting checks.
 -t                 Enable tainting warnings.
 -W                 Enable fatal warnings.
 -w                 Enable warnings.
 -h,  --help        Display this help
 -?,                Display this help
 -H,  --man         Longer manpage for prove

Options that take arguments:

 -I                 Library paths to include.
 -P                 Load plugin (searches App::Prove::Plugin::*.)
 -M                 Load a module.
 -e,  --exec        Interpreter to run the tests ('' for compiled tests.)
      --harness     Define test harness to use.  See TAP::Harness.
      --formatter   Result formatter to use. See TAP::Harness.
 -a,  --archive     Store the resulting TAP in an archive file.
 -j,  --jobs N      Run N test jobs in parallel (try 9.)

=head2 Reading from C<STDIN>

If you have a list of tests (or URLs, or anything else you want to test) in a
file, you can add them to your tests by using a '-':

 prove - < my_list_of_things_to_test.txt

See the C<README> in the C<examples> directory of this distribution.

=head1 NOTES

=head2 Default Test Directory

If no files or directories are supplied, C<prove> looks for all files
matching the pattern C<t/*.t>.

=head2 Colored Test Output

Colored test output is the default, but if output is not to a
terminal, color is disabled. You can override this by adding the 
C<--color> switch.

Color support requires L<Term::ANSIColor> on Unix-like platforms and
L<Win32::Console> windows. If the necessary module is not installed
colored output will not be available.

=head2 Arguments to Tests

It is possible to supply arguments to tests. To do so separate them from
prove's own arguments with '--'. For example

 prove -v t/mytest.t -- --url http://example.com
 
would run F<t/mytest.t> with the options '--url http://example.com'.
When running multiple tests they will each receive the same arguments.

=head2 C<--exec>

Normally you can just pass a list of Perl tests and the harness will know how
to execute them.  However, if your tests are not written in Perl or if you
want all tests invoked exactly the same way, use the C<-e>, or C<--exec>
switch:

 prove --exec '/usr/bin/ruby -w' t/
 prove --exec '/usr/bin/perl -Tw -mstrict -Ilib' t/
 prove --exec '/path/to/my/customer/exec'

=head2 C<--merge>

If you need to make sure your diagnostics are displayed in the correct
order relative to test results you can use the C<--merge> option to
merge the test scripts' STDERR into their STDOUT. 

This guarantees that STDOUT (where the test results appear) and STDOUT
(where the diagnostics appear) will stay in sync. The harness will
display any diagnostics your tests emit on STDERR.

Caveat: this is a bit of a kludge. In particular note that if anything
that appears on STDERR looks like a test result the test harness will
get confused. Use this option only if you understand the consequences
and can live with the risk.

=head2 C<--state>

You can ask C<prove> to remember the state of previous test runs and
select and/or order the tests to be run this time based on that
saved state.

The C<--state> switch requires an argument which must be a comma
separated list of one or more of the following options.

=over

=item C<last>

Run the same tests as the last time the state was saved. This makes it
possible, for example, to recreate the ordering of a shuffled test.

    # Run all tests in random order
    $ prove -b --state=save --shuffle

    # Run them again in the same order
    $ prove -b --state=last

=item C<failed>

Run only the tests that failed on the last run.

    # Run all tests
    $ prove -b --state=save
    
    # Run failures
    $ prove -b --state=failed

If you also specify the C<save> option newly passing tests will be
excluded from subsequent runs.

    # Repeat until no more failures
    $ prove -b --state=failed,save

=item C<passed>

Run only the passed tests from last time. Useful to make sure that no
new problems have been introduced.

=item C<all>

Run all tests in normal order. Multple options may be specified, so to
run all tests with the failures from last time first:

    $ prove -b --state=failed,all,save

=item C<hot>

Run the tests that most recently failed first. The last failure time of
each test is stored. The C<hot> option causes tests to be run in most-recent-
failure order.

    $ prove -b --state=hot,save

=item C<save>

Save the state on exit. The state is stored in a file called F<.prove>
(F<_prove> on Windows and VMS) in the current directory.

=back

=head3 Other Recipes

Run all the tests that passed last time on order of how recently they failed:

    $ prove --state=hot,passed,save

=head1 PERFORMANCE

Because of its design, C<TAP::Parser> collects more information than
C<Test::Harness>.  However, the trade-off is sometimes slightly slower
performance than when using the C<prove> utility which is bundled with
L<Test::Harness>.  For small tests suites, this is usually not a problem.
However, enabling the C<--quiet> or C<--QUIET> options can sometimes speed up
the test suite, sometimes running faster than C<prove>.

few places (thanks Andy!).
