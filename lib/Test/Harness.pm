=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Test::Harness;

  runtests(@test_files);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module exists to provide L<TAP::Harness> with an interface that is
somewhat backwards compatible with L<Test::Harness> 2.xx. If you're
writing new code consider using L<TAP::Harness> directly instead.

Emulation is provided for C<runtests> and C<execute_tests> but the
pluggable 'Straps' interface that previous versions of L<Test::Harness>
supported is not reproduced here.

See L<TAP::Parser> for the main documentation for this distribution.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

The following functions are available.

=head2 runtests( @test_files )

This runs all the given I<@test_files> and divines whether they passed
or failed based on their output to STDOUT (details above).  It prints
out each individual test which failed along with a summary report and
a how long it all took.

It returns true if everything was ok.  Otherwise it will C<die()> with
one of the messages in the DIAGNOSTICS section.

=head2 execute_tests( tests => \@test_files, out => \*FH )

Runs all the given C<@test_files> (just like C<runtests()>) but
doesn't generate the final report.  During testing, progress
information will be written to the currently selected output
filehandle (usually C<STDOUT>), or to the filehandle given by the
C<out> parameter.  The I<out> is optional.

Returns a list of two values, C<$total> and C<$failed>, describing the
results.  C<$total> is a hash ref summary of all the tests run.  Its
keys and values are this:

    bonus           Number of individual todo tests unexpectedly passed
    max             Number of individual tests ran
    ok              Number of individual tests passed
    sub_skipped     Number of individual tests skipped
    todo            Number of individual todo tests

    files           Number of test files ran
    good            Number of test files passed
    bad             Number of test files failed
    tests           Number of test files originally given
    skipped         Number of test files skipped

If C<< $total->{bad} == 0 >> and C<< $total->{max} > 0 >>, you've
got a successful test.

C<$failed> is a hash ref of all the test scripts that failed.  Each key
is the name of a test script, each value is another hash representing
how that script failed.  Its keys are these:

    name        Name of the test which failed
    estat       Script's exit value
    wstat       Script's wait status
    max         Number of individual tests
    failed      Number which failed
    canon       List of tests which failed (as string).

C<$failed> should be empty if everything passed.

=head1 EXPORT

C<&runtests> is exported by C<Test::Harness> by default.

C<&execute_tests>, C<$verbose>, C<$switches> and C<$debug> are
exported upon request.

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES THAT TAP::HARNESS::COMPATIBLE SETS

C<Test::Harness> sets these before executing the individual tests.

=over 4

=item C<HARNESS_ACTIVE>

This is set to a true value.  It allows the tests to determine if they
are being executed through the harness or by any other means.

=item C<HARNESS_VERSION>

This is the version of C<Test::Harness>.

=back

=head1 ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES THAT AFFECT TEST::HARNESS

=over 4

=item C<HARNESS_TIMER>

Setting this to true will make the harness display the number of
milliseconds each test took.  You can also use F<prove>'s C<--timer>
switch.

=item C<HARNESS_VERBOSE>

If true, C<Test::Harness> will output the verbose results of running
its tests.  Setting C<$Test::Harness::verbose> will override this,
or you can use the C<-v> switch in the F<prove> utility.

If true, C<Test::Harness> will output the verbose results of running
its tests.  Setting C<$Test::Harness::verbose> will override this,
or you can use the C<-v> switch in the F<prove> utility.
