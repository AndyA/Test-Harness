These are the bugs from Test::Harness as of March 18, 2007.  The "[ ]" box
should be checked off as we verify that each one is no longer an issue for
THC.  Feel free to add notes for each one, if needed.

Legend:

 [ ] - open issue (may be fixed, but research is needed)
 [*] - fixed
 [-] - not applicable (e.g., anything to do with Test::Harness::Straps)
 [!] - wont fix

  years ago     
  Note:  I don't think is an issue for THC, but I could be mistaken.

Fixed:

- [*] 14767   Can't locate Devel/Cover.pm in @INC during runtests()   new
  1 years ago
  Note: The person who raised the ticket wanted PERL5OPT to be
        cleared. Instead we propagate the test's libs into its
        children by setting PERL5LIB. This doesn't have the same
        effect but it does remove the failure due to PERL5OPT pointing
        to an unloadable module.
- [*] 17210   prove -b and prove -l should set PERL5LIB   new Important 1
  years ago 2.56

Not applicable:

  years ago     
  Note: I tried the steps outlined on this thread
        http://lyxus.net/ggr but couldn't reproduce the problem. It
        works fine on a recent Cygwin.
- [-] 14378   prove bug - incorrect IO redirection    new     1 years ago     
- [-] 16832   Redirect T::H output to a filehandle of one's choosing  new
  1 years ago     
  Note: We still have this problem with TAP::Harness::Compatible but
        new applications should use TAP::Harness which will shortly
        allow view delegates to be plugged which pretty much solves
        this problem.

  Note:  I believe that our --exec switch makes this a non-issue. We don't
  support --perl
- [-] 8753    Test::Harness should run executable .t files directly   open
  Important 10 months ago
