TODO:

    - Make the color support more intelligent.
    - Make the wait and exit codes work on Windows.
    - Have the aggregator return an iterator.
    - Make sure we get the right harness output with no tests run.
    - Make the 'colored' test output easier to override.
    - More tests, particularly IPC::Open3
    - Unknown callback keys should be fatal.
    - Run it against Perl's test suite (first prove, then tprove).
    - The 'result' objects are currently blessing hashrefs.  This is bad.
      Instead, they should have proper getter/setters to provide future
      support for subclassing.
    - Horrible idea:  have Mac's voice synthesis tell you when tests fail :)
